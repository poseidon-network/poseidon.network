          If you are in the market for a computer, there are a number of factors
          to consider. Will it be used for your home, your office or perhaps
          even your home office combo? First off, you will need to set a budget
          for your new purchase before deciding whether to shop for notebook or
          desktop computers. Many offices use desktop computers because they are
          not intended to be moved around a lot. In addition, affordability
          often plays a large role in someoneâ€™s decision as to whether to
          purchase notebook or desktop computers.
